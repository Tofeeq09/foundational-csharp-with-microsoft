1. **What is the purpose of defining an optional parameter in a method?**

   - `To cause a method to perform a different task.`
     > Incorrect. A method should generally perform the task it's named to do, and an optional parameter should reflect a trivial difference.
   - `To overload a method.`
     > Incorrect. Adding an optional parameter doesn't overload a method.
   - `To simplify the required parameters when a parameter isn't significant to the result.`
     > **Correct**! Optional parameters enable you to pass fewer arguments and accomplish the method task.

2. **What is the purpose of pseudo-code?**

   - `To provide a design template for the intended code.`
     > **Correct**! Pseudo-code helps to bridge the gap between concept and code.
   - `To safely cast operations performed in methods.`
     > Incorrect. Pseudo-code doesn't have an effect on written operations.
   - `To develop syntactically correct code.`
     > Incorrect. Pseudo-code doesn't help with syntax, instead it plans general tasks before the exact code is written.
