# Iterate through a code block using for statement in `C#`

## Knowledge check - <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/csharp-for/5-knowledge-check>

1. **Which of the following `for` statements is correct?**

   - `for (int x = 20: x < 80: x++)`
     > Incorrect. A colon cannot be used as an end of statement operator.
   - `for (int j = 0; j == 80; j + 1)`
     > Incorrect. The iterator section `j + 1` causes a compilation error.
   - `for (int counter = 20; counter < 80; counter++)`
     > **Correct**! This example shows the correct syntax for initializer, condition, and iterator.

2. **Which statement can be used to exit out of the `for` loop?**

   - `break;`
     > **Correct**! The `break` keyword can be used to exit a `for` loop.
   - `exit;`
     > Incorrect. `Exit` isn't a keyword in C#.
   - `return;`
     > Incorrect. The `return` keyword would exit out of the entire method.
