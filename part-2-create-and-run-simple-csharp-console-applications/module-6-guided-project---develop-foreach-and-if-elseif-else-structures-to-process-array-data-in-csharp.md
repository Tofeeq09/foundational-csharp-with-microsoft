# Guided project - Develop foreach and if-elseif-else structures to process array data in `C#`

## Introduction

Creating a code branch and iterating through a code block are essential capabilities for a developer. In C#, the `if` statement can be used to evaluate an expression and branch the execution path. The code block of a `foreach` statement can be used to iterate through each element of an array. Powerful and extensible applications can be created by combining the ability to iterate through an array with the ability to branch the execution path.

Suppose you're a teacher's assistant at a school. You've been working with a teacher to create an application that automates the grading process. Your C# programming skills have increased since you completed the initial version of your application. The teacher has asked you to update your application. The updates focus on using arrays, `foreach` statements, and `if` statements. The teacher also wants you to include extra credit assignments in your calculations of the final grades.

In this module, you'll be guided through the process of updating your Student Grading application. You'll use arrays to store student names and the scores of graded assignments, and you'll use `foreach` statements to iterate through array values. Each student's final grade will be calculated inside a `foreach` code block. You'll use an `if` statement to assign a final letter grade. Your completed application will output student grades using the teacher's score report specification.

### Project Overview

You're developing a Student Grading application that automates the calculation of grades for each student in a class. The parameters for your application are:

- Create a C# console application.
- Start with four students. Each student has five exam scores.
- Each exam score is an integer value, 0-100, where 100 represents 100% correct.
- A student's overall exam score is the average of their five exam scores.

Criteria for extra credit assignments:

- Include extra credit assignment scores in the student's scores array.
- Extra credit assignments are worth 10% of an exam score (when calculating the final numeric grade).
- Add extra credit assignment scores to the student's total exam score before calculating the final numeric grade.

Your application needs to automatically assign letter grades based on the calculated final score for each student. Your application needs to output/display each studentâ€™s name and formatted grade. Your application needs to support adding other students and scores with minimal impact to the code.

You've already completed an initial version of the application. The Starter code provides the following code features:

- The code declares variables used to define student names and individual exam scores for each student.
- The code includes the variables and algorithms used to sum the exam scores and calculate the average exam score for each student.
- The code includes a hard coded letter grade that the developer must apply manually.
- The code includes `Console.WriteLine()` statements to display the student grading report.

> **Your goal is to update the existing code to include the following features:**
>
> - Use arrays to store student names and assignment scores.
> - Use a `foreach` statement to iterate through the student names as an outer program loop.
> - Use an `if` statement within the outer loop to identify the current student name and access that student's assignment scores.
> - Use a `foreach` statement within the outer loop to iterate through the assignment scores array and sum the values.
> - Use an updated algorithm within the outer loop to calculate the average exam score for each student.
> - Use an `if-elseif-else` construct within the outer loop to evaluate the average exam score and assign a letter grade automatically.
> Integrate extra credit scores when calculating the student's final score and letter grade as follows:
>   - Your code must detect extra credit assignments based on the number of elements in the student's scores array.
>   - Your code must apply the 10% weighting factor to extra credit assignments before adding extra credit scores to the sum of exam scores.

The following list shows the letter grade that corresponds to numeric scores:

```txt
97 - 100   A+
93 - 96    A
90 - 92    A-
87 - 89    B+
83 - 86    B
80 - 82    B-
77 - 79    C+
73 - 76    C
70 - 72    C-
67 - 69    D+
63 - 66    D
60 - 62    D-
0  - 59    F
```

The update application needs to produce a formatted student grading report that appears as follows:

```txt
Student         Grade

Sophia:         92.2    A-
Andrew:         89.6    B+
Emma:           85.6    B
Logan:          91.2    A-
```

### Starter code

```csharp
using System;

// initialize variables - graded assignments 
int currentAssignments = 5;

int sophia1 = 90;
int sophia2 = 86;
int sophia3 = 87;
int sophia4 = 98;
int sophia5 = 100;

int andrew1 = 92;
int andrew2 = 89;
int andrew3 = 81;
int andrew4 = 96;
int andrew5 = 90;

int emma1 = 90;
int emma2 = 85;
int emma3 = 87;
int emma4 = 98;
int emma5 = 68;

int logan1 = 90;
int logan2 = 95;
int logan3 = 87;
int logan4 = 88;
int logan5 = 96;

int sophiaSum = 0;
int andrewSum = 0;
int emmaSum = 0;
int loganSum = 0;

decimal sophiaScore;
decimal andrewScore;
decimal emmaScore;
decimal loganScore;

sophiaSum = sophia1 + sophia2 + sophia3 + sophia4 + sophia5;
andrewSum = andrew1 + andrew2 + andrew3 + andrew4 + andrew5;
emmaSum = emma1 + emma2 + emma3 + emma4 + emma5;
loganSum = logan1 + logan2 + logan3 + logan4 + logan5;

sophiaScore = (decimal)sophiaSum / currentAssignments;
andrewScore = (decimal)andrewSum / currentAssignments;
emmaScore = (decimal)emmaSum / currentAssignments;
loganScore = (decimal)loganSum / currentAssignments;

Console.WriteLine("Student\t\tGrade\n");
Console.WriteLine("Sophia:\t\t" + sophiaScore + "\tA-");
Console.WriteLine("Andrew:\t\t" + andrewScore + "\tB+");
Console.WriteLine("Emma:\t\t" + emmaScore + "\tB");
Console.WriteLine("Logan:\t\t" + loganScore + "\tA-");

Console.WriteLine("Press the Enter key to continue");
Console.ReadLine();
```

## Use arrays to store student names and assignment scores

```csharp
int currentAssignments = 5;

string[] studentNames = ["Sophia", "Andrew", "Emma", "Logan"];

int[] sophiaScores = [90, 86, 87, 98, 100, 94, 90];
int[] andrewScores = [92, 89, 81, 96, 90, 89];
int[] emmaScores = [90, 85, 87, 98, 68, 89, 89, 89];

int[] ericScores = [80, 90, 100, 80, 90, 100, 80, 90];
int[] gregorScores = [91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91];

Console.WriteLine("Press the Enter key to continue");
Console.ReadLine();
```

## Use a `foreach` statement to iterate through the student names as an outer program loop

```csharp

foreach (string name in studentNames)
{
      Console.WriteLine(name);
}

Console.WriteLine("\n\rPress the Enter key to continue");
Console.ReadLine();
```

## Use an if statement within the outer loop to identify the current student name and access that student's assignment scores

```csharp

        studentScores = loganScores;

      Console.WriteLine($"{currentStudent}\t\t{studentScores}");
}

Console.WriteLine("\n\rPress the Enter key to continue");
Console.ReadLine();
```

## Use a foreach statement within the outer loop to iterate through the assignment scores array and sum the values

```csharp

## Integrate extra credit scores when calculating the student's final score and letter grade

- Your code must detect extra credit assignments based on the number of elements in the student's scores array.
- Your code must apply the 10% weighting factor to extra credit assignments before adding extra credit scores to the sum of exam scores.

Criteria for extra credit assignments:

- Include extra credit assignment scores in the student's scores array.
- Extra credit assignments are worth 10% of an exam score (when calculating the final numeric grade).
- Add extra credit assignment scores to the student's total exam score before calculating the final numeric grade.

     > **Correct**! A `foreach` loop will iterate through all of the elements in an array.
   - `Place the original foreach loop inside the code block of a second foreach loop that iterates twice.`
     > Incorrect. This will cause the array elements to be processed twice.

2. **A developer is working on a nested `foreach` structure that iterates through all of an application's data arrays. The first array contains the names of locations where water samples were collected. The remaining arrays contain the test results for the samples collected from each named location. Which of the following statements about how the arrays should be processed is correct?**

   - `Each of the arrays containing samples can be processed by the outer loop, the inner loop will be used to verify the location.`
     > Incorrect. The outer `foreach` loop can only process one array, so it can't process each of the arrays containing samples.
   - `The order in which the arrays are processed doesn't matter since the application has to process all of the data.`
     > Incorrect. The relationship between outer and inner `foreach` loops is critical. The application won't be able to process all of the array data that's described in this scenario if the nested `foreach` structure isn't established correctly.
   - `The outer loop must process the array containing locations, the inner loop must process the arrays containing samples.`
     > **Correct**! The outer loop will iterate through the locations. The code block of the outer loop will be used to select the samples array for each location, and then process the sample in the inner `foreach` loop.
