## Knowledge check - <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/csharp-if-elseif-else/6-knowledge-check>

1. **Given that `int x = 5`, which of the following Boolean expressions is valid and evaluates to true?**

   - `x < 5.`
     > Incorrect. Since `x` isn't less than `5`, this expression evaluates to false.
   - `x > 5.`
     > Incorrect. Since `x` isn't greater than `5`, this expression evaluates to false.
   - `x == 5.`
     > **Correct**! Since `x` is equal to `5`, using the C# equality operator `==` in the expression evaluates to true.

2. **Which of the choices below is not a valid operator in C#?**

   - `%%.`
     > **Correct**! The double percentage-sign symbol `%%` isn't a valid C# operator.
   - `&&.`
     > Incorrect. `&&` is the C# logical AND operator.
   - `||.`
     > Incorrect. `||` is the C# logical OR operator.

3. **The following answer choices describe `if` statement syntax. Which of the descriptions is correct?**

   - `The Boolean expression evaluated by an if statement is optional.`
     > Incorrect. A Boolean expression is a required component of an `if` statement.
   - `An else statement can't be placed before an else if statement.`
     > **Correct**! An `else` can't be placed before an `else if` statement.
   - `The else statement is required when an if statement includes an else if.`
     > Incorrect. The `else` statement isn't required in order to create a valid `if` statement.
